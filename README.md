Higher Education System Analytics," was undertaken to address key operational challenges within the International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) department at Texas A&M University-Commerce. 
The primary goal was to enhance the support services provided to international students through the implementation of technical business solutions.

**Problems and Issues Identified**

Extensive Paperwork and Record Tracking:
Difficulty in tracking and managing extensive paperwork.
Time-consuming processes that required significant memory space for downloads.
High internal costs and budgeting issues associated with these processes.

Immigration Form Management:

Tedious and time-consuming process of filling out multiple immigration forms.
Unclear process flow and difficulty in navigation.
Inconsistent or incorrect data entry, causing a burden on the faculty/staff.

Financial issues before every event:
With every semester our department would face financial issues including budgets.
We had a budget of $500 for more than 300 students and we had to fit into this budget.
It was really a big deal breaker to have count of students to prepare our inventory.

**Business Solutions Implemented**
Workflow for Paperwork and Records:

Implemented a systematic workflow to digitize and streamline paperwork and record-tracking processes.
Utilized key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the percentage of course/credits completion, completion rate by country, and retention rates to monitor performance.

Integrated Multiple Immigration Forms in One:
Developed a new workflow to integrate multiple immigration forms into a single, unified process.
Simplified the process flow to ensure consistent and correct data entry, reducing the burden on faculty and staff.

Analyzed Graduating students data:
Collected all international students data for analysis.
Performed cleaning and created dashboard for analysis, saved costs and budget.

**Conclusion**
The implementation of the new workflows and systems at the ISSS department fostered a more collaborative environment for both users and advisors. 
This processes ensured clear communication, faster processing times, and efficient access to information, ultimately benefiting all stakeholders involved in the department.
Analysis also concluded the amount of students be graduating in that particular semester which could have direct budget allocation for the next new student arrival events as well as seats.

By integrating innovative technical business solutions, the project successfully addressed the key effectiveness of saving money, time and efforts of the ISSS department at Texas A&M University-Commerce.
